This directory contains a simple regression test for kqemu called
'kqemutest'. Use 'kqemutest -h' to get the usage.

It can test user only virtualization or full virtualization. The test
basically implements a very simple OS kernel (kerneltest.c) with a
small user application (usertest.c) which tests various corner
cases. In case of user only virtualization, the simple OS kernel is
not used and kqemutest emulates the kernel system calls.

Note: gcc 4 is currently not supported because of inline asm problems.
